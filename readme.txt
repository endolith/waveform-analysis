Somewhat crude THD+N calculator in Python

Measures the total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) for a given input 
signal, by guessing the fundamental frequency (finding the peak in the FFT), 
and notching it out in the frequency domain.

Depends on Audiolab and SciPy

Example of usage, with 997 Hz full-scale sine wave generated by Adobe Audition 
at 96 kHz, showing the 16-bit quantization distortion:

> python thdcalculator.py "perfect 997 Hz no dither.flac"
Frequency:	997.000000 Hz
THD+N:  	0.0016% or -96.1 dB

(Is this right?  Theoretical SNR of a FS sine is 1.761+6.02*16 = -98.09 dB.  
Close, at least.)

According to the never-wrong Wikipedia:
* THD is the fundamental alone vs the harmonics alone
* THD+N is the entire signal (not just the fundamental) vs the entire signal 
with the fundamental notched out.  (For low distortion, the difference between 
the entire signal and the fundamental is negligible.)

The primary problem with the current script is that I don't know how much of 
the surrounding region of the peak to throw away.  Probably the way to match 
other test equipment is to just calculate the width of a certain bandwidth, 
but is that really ideal?

width = 50
f[i-width: i+width+1] = 0

Instead of a fixed width, it currently just tries to find the nearest local 
minima and throw away everything between them.  It works for almost all cases, 
but on peaks with wider "skirts", it gets stuck at any notches.  Should this 
be considered part of the peak or part of the noise (jitter)?

By comparison, Audio Precision manual states "Bandreject Response typically 
–3 dB at 0.725 f0 & 1.38 f0", which is about 0.93 octaves.

Also it computes the FFT for the entire sample, which is a waste of time.  Use 
short samples.

Comparing a test device on an Audio Precision System One 22 kHz filtered vs recorded 
into my 96 kHz 24-bit sound card and measured with this script:

100         0.15%       0.19%
100         0.15%       0.14%
140         0.15%       0.17%
440         0.056%      0.057%

1021        0.080%      0.082%

13640       12.2%       16.8%
19998       20.2%       56.3%  (nasty intermodulation distortion)
20044       0.22%       0.30%

So it's mostly accurate.   Mostly.
